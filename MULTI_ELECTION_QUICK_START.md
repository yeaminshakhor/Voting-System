## Troubleshooting 🔧

### "I can't vote in the second election"
**Check**: 
- Is voting allowed? (Ask admin if elections are open)
- Did you vote before? (Check history on login screen)
- What's the policy? (ALLOW=ok, RESTRICT=blocked)

### "I forgot what elections I voted in"
**Solution**:
1. Login to voting interface
2. View "Your Voting History" 
3. See all elections you participated in

### "Admin changed policy and now I'm blocked"
**Note**: Policy change applies to NEW votes only
- If you already voted, you're recorded
- Contact admin if there's an issue
